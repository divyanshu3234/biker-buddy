# biker's-buddy

A minimal Android HUD for motorcyclists using old or secondary Android phones.

## Why this exists

- Phone-mounted navigation damages modern phone cameras
- Dedicated HUDs and CarPlay screens are expensive
- Riders need glanceable information, not full apps

This project turns any old Android phone into a simple motorcycle HUD.

## What Edition 1 does

- Shows Google Maps turn direction
- Displays GPS-based speed
- Incoming call alerts
- Music playback controls
- Designed for helmet intercom use
- Touch disabled while moving

## What it does NOT do

- No CarPlay
- No screen mirroring
- No messaging
- No cloud accounts

This is a secondary riding display, not a phone replacement.

## Tech stack

- Android
- Kotlin
- Jetpack Compose
- Google Location Services
- Bluetooth (HFP + AVRCP)

## Safety note

Do not interact with the screen while riding.
Use helmet/intercom controls for calls and music.
